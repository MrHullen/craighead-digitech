  <h3> Implications </h3>

<h3>Legal</h3>
    <p>Copyright law recognises that most digital media (images, illustrations, movies and other media) are likely to be protected by copyright. This means that a user will need the permission of the copyright owner to be able to copy the media or share it on the internet. </p>
    <p>A Creative Commons license is one of several copyright licenses that allow the distribution of copyrighted works. Creative commons licences make it easy for a copyright owner to share their original works. They ensure that others can copy and distribute original work, provided they give the owner credit and only on the conditions specified by the owner.</p>
    <p>
      Consider whether your design abides by the <a href=&quot;https://www.justice.govt.nz/justice-sector-policy/key-initiatives/harmful-digital-communications/&quot;>NetSafe</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/general-help/consumer-laws/online-safety-laws-and-rules/#harmful-digital-communications&quot;>Consumer Protection</a>). If there is any personal information included, or images of people, consider if you have ensured their permission has been provided and their personal data is kept private.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Copyright</h3>
    <p>
      Generally, if the client has provided images then they likely own them, but it pays to check. Any additional images you use you need to check you have permission to use them, either from the owner directly or under their License. If you need to give credit to the sources, you can do that in the image caption or in the footer.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ethical</h3>
    <p>
      Ethical considerations are things that aren't technically illegal but you shouldn't do them anyway. Check that your outcome doesn't exploit anyone, and encourages responsible behaviour.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Cultural</h3>
    <p>Making sure to get the names and spelling correctly adheres to social and cultural responsibility. If facing names or place names that include macrons or a specific spelling, then spelling these incorrectly can be seen as culturally insensitive and/or offensive to the person/culture they belong to.</p>
    <p>
      Any cultures depicted in your outcome need to be shown fairly and accurately. Enure that you've included any alternative names for organisations, any mottos, etc. and that the spelling and macrons are correct.

  <h3> User considerations </h3>
  
  <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      Can it be access on different devices and browsers (<em>Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer; and mobile and desktop</em>)?
    </p>

    <p>
      Can it be used by differently abled people (<em>colour-blind safe colours, appropriate-sized and well-contrasting text, labels for inputs, aria labels where appropriate, etc.</em>)?
    </p>
  
  <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>
      Does the app work the way a user would expect (<em>do links look like links, headings in logical hierarchy, etc.</em>)?
    </p>
    
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>
      Do the parts of the app do what they're supposed to (<em>do the links go to the right pages, do the images show up, etc.</em>)?
    </p>
    
    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <p>
      Does the app appeal to the right audience?
    </p>

    <p>
      Does it use design principles (<em>complimentary colours, white space, alignments, etc.</em>)?
    </p>

  <h3> Justification </h3>

  <h3>Appropriateness</h3>
    <p>
      Describe how your design is appropriate for your purpose and audience. You <b>must</b> link the design choices your made (which colours, fonts, layout, and imagery) to the purpose and audience that you defined at the beginning.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Example: The blue colour I chose as the primary colour is appropriate for my business audience because blue is associated with professionalism.
    </blockquote>

  
  <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <p>
      Why are the colours, fonts, layouts, and imagery appropriate for your purpose and audience?
    </p>

  <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
      Which methods helped the most, which didn't.
    </p>

    <p>
      What you would do next time and where you can take it from here.
