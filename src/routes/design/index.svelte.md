## Empathise & Define *- Te Pō* <a name="empathise-define"></a>

Tasks in this stage: observe, ask, listen, research, define, focus

<Box title="Purpose">

Most often in school you'll be given a brief the will guide you in defining the purpose of the outcome. Your purpose should be clear and specific, so that it will help you decide whether what you've created is appropriate or not. To define the purpose, you'll need to do some research to understand what you're working on. If what you've made fulfils the purpose - great! If not, it's time for another ideation session or iteration of improvement.

> *Example: you might be given the brief "create a web app for a kindergarten to help the kids learn." You then research what they need by looking online, visiting one, talking to teachers, and asking some parents. Once you know a bit about it, you define the purpose as "the web app will improve kids' visual recognition of animals, shapes, numbers, colours, patterns, and letters." With this as your web app's purpose, you can easy test and say whether your web app fulfils this or not.*

</Box>

<Box title="Audience">

It can be tempting to say that your outcome is for "everybody." While it's true that "everybody" should be able to use it, the audience that you're *targeting* should be more specific. Defining for a very specific audience makes design decisions easier because you can choose the option that most appeals to that group. It also makes it much easier to justify later in the process because you can link your decisions strongly to your purpose and audience.

> *Example: say you're designing a web app and you've defined the audience as "kindergarteners". You need to choose a set of colours and are deciding between some shades of blue, or very bright primary colours. The shades of blue might appeal more to "everybody," but you're designing for little kids so the bright primary colours are more appropriate.*

## Ideate *- Te Wehenga* <a name="empathise-define"></a>

Tasks in this stage: brainstorm, create, ideate

<Box title="Colours">

Consider the colours that your client uses or wants to use and include them in your design if appropriate. When you're deciding on other colours to include there are two basic things to consider: what feeling the colours bring out in people, and whether they work with your existing colours.

You can do some [research online](https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-your-soul-color-48cb568395fd) to find out what [feelings each colour evokes](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/), and to see whether the colours work together (or find new ones) you can use online tools such as [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

</Box>

<Box title="Fonts">

Headings can be fancy, body text must be readable, and subheadings can be somewhere in between. To begin, choose sets of three fonts that you feel work well together. A place to easily find free downloadable fonts and get combination recommendations is [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

</Box>

<Box title="Layout">

- Wireframes

</Box>

<Box title="Imagery">

Consider the images you've been provided (if any) and decide which ones you'll use and where in your design they'll go. If you need more images, you can contact your client, or an excellent source of freely-usable images is [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) where you can search by keyword, size, and even shape.

## Prototype *- Te Ao Mārama* <a name="prototype"></a>

Tasks in this stage: analyse, choose, create

<Box title="Lo-fi prototype">

A paper and pens is often the quickest way to put together a prototype to help you visualise layout, colour, and usability. Do a rough(ish) drawing of each page on a separate landscape A4, including your header and navigation.

You can present the home page to users, and swap out the "pages" as they tap on each navigation button. It's primitive, but extremely effective for getting quick feedback. You can learn if your layout doesn't suit, or if your navigation isn't intuitive. Ask questions like "what do you think this button will do?" and "which menu do you expect that to be under?"

## Reflect *- Te Whakaata* <a name="reflect"></a>

Tasks in this stage: identify issues, consider impacts, seek feedback

### Implications

<Box title="Legal">

Consider whether your design abides by the [Harmful Digital Communications Act](https://www.justice.govt.nz/justice-sector-policy/key-initiatives/harmful-digital-communications/) (explained on [NetSafe](https://www.netsafe.org.nz/advice/harmfuldigitalcommunications/) and [Consumer Protection](https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/general-help/consumer-laws/online-safety-laws-and-rules/#harmful-digital-communications)). If there is any personal information included, or images of people, consider if you have ensured their permission has been provided and their personal data is kept private.

</Box>

<Box title="Copyright">

Generally, if the client has provided images then they likely own them, but it pays to check. Any additional images you use you need to check you have permission to use them, either from the owner directly or under their License. If you need to give credit to the sources, you can do that in the image caption or in the footer.

</Box>

<Box title="Ethical">

Ethical considerations are things that aren't technically illegal but you shouldn't do them anyway. Check that your outcome doesn't exploit anyone, and encourages responsible behaviour.

</Box>

<Box title="Cultural">

Any cultures depicted in your outcome need to be shown fairly and accurately. Enure that you've included any alternative names for organisations, any mottos, etc. and that the spelling and macrons are correct.

</Box>

---

### User considerations

<Box title="Accessibility">

Can it be access on different devices and browsers (*Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer; and mobile and desktop*)?

Can it be used by differently abled people (*colour-blind safe colours, appropriate-sized and well-contrasting text, labels for inputs, aria labels where appropriate, etc.*)?

</Box>

<Box title="Usability">

Does the app work the way a user would expect (*do links look like links, headings in logical hierarchy, etc.*)?

</Box>

<Box title="Functionality">

Do the parts of the app do what they're supposed to (*do the links go to the right pages, do the images show up, etc.*)?

</Box>

<Box title="Aesthetics">

Does the app appeal to the right audience?

Does it use design principles (*contrast and/or complimentary colours, white space, alignments, etc.*)?
